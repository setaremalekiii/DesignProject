# DesignProject
## **Overview**
This project uses the capabilities of Virtual Reality (VR) to offer a straightforward training environment for testing a Physical Control Unit (PCU)'s keypad functionality. By integrating an Arduino with a pressure sensor to detect physical button presses, this application provides real-time feedback and displays relevant information within a Unity-based VR simulation. This approach allows for an interactive learning experience, enabling users to familiarize themselves with the PCU's operations through practical engagement.

## **Features**
- Real-time Button Press Detection: Utilizes an Arduino equipped with a pressure sensor to accurately detect when a button on the PCU is pressed.
- Dynamic Information Display: Corresponding information or instructions are displayed within the VR environment, depending on which button is pressed, facilitating a hands-on learning experience.
- VR Immersion: Offers a virtual replication of the PCU's interface within a VR setting, allowing users to interact with the keypad as if it were the real thing.
